## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


Here's the pseudocode for our problem. your task is to fill out thew code, run it, report the answer and then push it back to me using the reposiutory that was created when you accepted this 'assignment' via the invitation you received from github.

First create some global variables to dictate the parameters of the problem
```{r globals}
#How many simulations to run?
NumberOfSims<-1000
#What is the size of the grid?
a<-10
b<-5
set.seed(123)  # set the seed for the random number generator - this makes sure the results are reproducible when we are debugging

#Declare a variable to keep track of the sum of the distances across all simulations
Distance<-0
```


Now simulate the process of choosing points randomly within the grid.
```{r simulate}
for (i in 1:NumberOfSims){
  # generate z1 (so generate it's x and y coordinates)
  z1<-cbind(runif(1,0,a),runif(1,0,b))
  # generate z2 (likewise)
  z2 <- cbind(runif(1,0,a), runif(1,0,b))

  # Use Pythagoras' theorem to find the distance between them
  d <- sqrt ((z1[1]-z2[1])^2 + (z1[2]-z2[2])^2)
  # Add the distance to the variable Distance
  Distance <- Distance + d
}
# Divide Distance by NumberOfSims to calculate the average distance we observed across all sims
AverageDistance<-Distance/NumberOfSims
```

Then report your output and add any explanatory text you need to help the read what is going on.

```{r output}
cat("\nOur estimate of the expected distance between the two points is ",AverageDistance)
```

It would beetter still to keep each distance in a vector and then plot a histogram of its distribution? 
Is the distribution from a family you recognize? (e.g. Normal, Poisson, Exponential,...?)
Is there a theoretical answer to this problem?
